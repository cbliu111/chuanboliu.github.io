<p>I&rsquo;m a reseacher at <a href="http://english.ciac.cas.cn/">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, working on the physical principles of deep learning and application of machine learning to understand complex systems, such as the gene regulation network, and dynamics of brain.<br>
I finished my PhD at the <a href="https://english.ucas.ac.cn/">University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/chemistry/faculty/_faculty-profiles/wang-jin">Jin Wang</a> and Prof. <a href="http://english.ciac.cas.cn/sourcedb/yw/ymrck/yjy/202408/t20240806_681864.html">Erkang Wang</a>.
In particular, my PhD research focuses on understanding the physical principle that governing the self-organized folding and interaction of intrinsic disordered proteins.
I switch my focus then to the broad application of theory of disordered systems to other complex systems, such as brains and the deep neural networks.<br>
<p><strong>My research interests including: </strong> Physical theories of deep learning, Stochastic dynamics of complex systems, Inferencing dynamical laws from data, Brain-inspired learning.</p>
My long-term research objective is uncovering the underlying principle that shared by both deep neural networks and brains; with a unified theory to explain the emergent intelligence, we can design energy efficient, interpretable, and self-consistent autonomous intelligent agent that can explore, accumulate, and organize knowledge continually in real world.</p>
