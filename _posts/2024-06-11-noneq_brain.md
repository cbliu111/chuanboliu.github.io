Brain must operates far from thermal equilibrium, since time for perception and decision-making are very limited, and they should use as few degrees of freedom as possible {wolpertStochasticThermodynamicsKey2024}. 
According to the thermodynamic speed limit theorems, there eixsts a nonzero lower bounds on the entropy production, which increases as the required time shrinks. 
Moreover, any periodic process has a nonzero entropy production. 
Indeed, nonequilibrium macroscopic brain dynamics is a robust signature of consciousness {sanzperlNonequilibriumBrainDynamics2021}. 

Whole-brain imaging data suggest the brain nearly obeys detailed balance when at rest, but strongly breaks detailed balance when performing physically and cognitively demanding tasks {lynnBrokenDetailedBalance2021}. 
Similar macroscopic detailed balance broken can emerged from asymmetric Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, where there are both positive and negative interactions. 
Therefore, brain may also has two kind of connections: one propagates positive activity and the other propagates negative error. 

This observation suggests the brain remain at equilibrium when it faithfully predict the input of sensory signals, but becoming nonequilibrium when new, unexpected sensory signals present. 
This can be understood by the MDP framework: at rest, the backward path fully align with the forward path, and there is detailed balance between the forward and backward path. 
If some unexpected signals are present, the forward path deviates from the prediction of the backward path, therefore breaks the detailed balance, and triggers the modification of connectivity weights. 
The broken of detailed balance leads to the production of entroy, and the brain adjusts its synaptic weights to minimize the dissipation. 

The brain must be in a nonequilibrium state when performing any cognitive functions, from computations and attention to planning and moter execution. 
The brain's neural networks exhibit complex dynamics that are essential for cognitive functions such as perception, memory, and consciousness. Nonequilibrium states support these dynamics by allowing for a wide range of neural activity patterns.
Nonequilibrium states enable the brain to adapt to new environments and learn from experiences. This adaptability is crucial for survival, allowing organisms to modify their behavior based on past experiences and future predictions.
The brain constantly receives and processes a vast amount of sensory information. Operating at a nonequilibrium state allows it to dynamically respond to new stimuli and make rapid decisions.
Operating at nonequilibrium allows the brain to be robust against perturbations while still being flexible enough to change. This balance is crucial for maintaining stable cognitive functions in the face of internal and external changes.
The brain exhibits spontaneous neural activity even in the absence of external stimuli. This activity is thought to be important for maintaining neural circuits and preparing the brain for future tasks.
